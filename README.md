## What is this project about?
This project is about fractals that are complex patterns that are created by repeating a simple process driven by recursion. In this project we had the chance to modify some already given fractals and study how they worked. Additionally we created two of our own.

## Implemented Functionality: 
- Created the FractalMode class and converted the previous fractal functions into classes.
- Edited some fractals to adjust functionality.
- Added two new fractals, ellipse fractal and box fractal.
- Added an animation feature.
- Added a key to change depth.
